I am currently developing a console-based Solana wallet aimed at assisting developers in efficiently managing multiple Solana accounts. The development process will be documented here, and upon completion, `SolWallet` will be made available for download.

**SolWallet:** Will be supported on Windows/Linux/MacOS.

_Note: Swaps conducted using SolWallet will incur a 0.8% fee._
